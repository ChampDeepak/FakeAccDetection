Fake Social Media Account Detection System 
- This system uses a hybrid ML model for its inference. 
- At its core the System is consist of 
   - DBSCAN and
   - Random Forest
-  DBSCAN is used to perdict non overlaping clusters whereas RF is used to make inference in case of overlapping clusters. 
- It was fun working on this project. We are still experimenting on the solution approach and would be happy to incorporate your suggestions as well.
